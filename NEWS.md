# Version 0.3.0 (2019-12-28)

* Implement `heddle` function, making it easy to swap out placeholder keywords
  in piped code
* Implement `make_template` function, letting you combine `heddle` elements 
  into single exportable templates
* Code styled and documentation properly linked (I think!)
* Github project pieces added (Contributing guidelines, code of conduct, 
  issue templates)
* Builds now test against every version of R on Linux and Mac with support in
  Travis and rlang
