## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have changed the following:

* Edited the license file to only contain the lines COPYRIGHT HOLDER and YEAR
* Edited the repostatus.org URL to a full link
* Added small executable examples in your Rd-files.
* Changed the tests in export_template to not modify the user's home filespace
  (export_template tests now use stdout() instead of a file)

## Test environments
* Local Ubuntu 19.04 install, R 3.6.2
* Linux 16.04 (travis-ci), R devel, release, and oldrelease
* Mac OSX (travis-ci), R release and oldrelease
* win-builder (devel, release, and oldrelease) 

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was one NOTE:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
