This vignette serves as a basic introduction to the `heddlr` package, a set of 
utilities to make it easier to write R Markdown documents with sections that 
repeat or which might need to add or remove sections based on an underlying 
data source. In order to demonstrate the essentials of how the package works,
let's imagine we have a super cool R Markdown document, which looks something
like this:

```

# Let's talk about irises!

## Iris setosa

This species of flower is great! It has a mean sepal length of 
`.r mean(iris[iris$Species == "setosa", "Sepal.Length"])`, and a
mean sepal width of `.r mean(iris[iris$Species == "setosa", "Sepal.Width"])`. 
That looks like this on a graph!

.```{r}
iris %>%
  filter(Species == "setosa") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) + 
  geom_point()
.```

## Iris virginica

This species of flower is great! It has a mean sepal length of 
`.r mean(iris[iris$Species == "virginica", "Sepal.Length"])`, and a
mean sepal width of `.r mean(iris[iris$Species == "virginica", "Sepal.Width"])`. 
That looks like this on a graph!

.```{r}
iris %>%
  filter(Species == "virginica") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) + 
  geom_point()
.```

```

This is a great report, and it probably didn't take that long to create.
However, one day Joe down the hall points out that there are actually
more types of irises than the ones you're always talking about - and your
database already has information about one called versicolor!

If you wanted, you could go ahead and copy and paste the species section again,
making sure to change all the species names to versicolor. However, there's 
some level of risk associated with that -- you can wind up with errors in your 
reporting if you miss replacing a value. More importantly, though, 
is that copying and pasting by hand doesn't scale to reports which are put
out often and need multiple sections added or removed. It can save a lot of 
time and energy to instead automate that task away.

That's the motivation behind `heddlr`^[It's a play on the 
[loom component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heddle), since we're trying to 
automate the Sweave/knitr process and someone already took the name `loomr`. ]:
to reduce that repetitive work and, as a side effect, simplify your code. To do
so, `heddlr` looks at reports as a collection of components, which we'll call
patterns. As it happens, our super cool report above is made up of two patterns -- 
first, the setup material:

```
---
title: "My cool report!"
author: "Captain heddlr"
output: html_document
---

.```{r setup}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
.```
# Let's talk about irises!

```

And secondly the species-specific section, which gets repeated for each
species in our dataset -- I've swapped the specific name out for a placeholder
value:

```
## Iris SPECIES_NAME

This species of flower is great! It has a mean sepal length of 
`.r mean(iris[iris$Species == "SPECIES_NAME", "Sepal.Length"])`, and a
mean sepal width of `.r mean(iris[iris$Species == "SPECIES_NAME", "Sepal.Width"])`. 
That looks like this on a graph!

.```{r}
iris %>%
  filter(Species == "SPECIES_NAME") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) + 
  geom_point()
.```

```

When using `heddlr`, we'll usually go ahead and save each of those patterns in
their own files -- for our example report, we'll name those files 
`setup_pattern.Rmd` and `species_pattern.Rmd` respectively^[In order for the 
vignettes for this package to build correctly, I haven't actually saved these 
files off separately -- if you look at the source code for this vignette, 
you'll notice I'm not actually using the `heddlr` functions, but rather using 
some workarounds to get the same exact results. ].

We then have a few ways we can import them into our R session. Let's load 
`heddlr` and then walk through them:

```{r}
library(heddlr)
```

The first and most straightforward method is to use `heddlr::import_pattern()`,
which does more or less what you'd expect and imports a single pattern into a 
single R object.

```{r include=FALSE}
setup_pattern <- "---\ntitle: \"My cool report!\"\nauthor: \"Captain heddlr\"\noutput: html_document\n---\n\n```{r setup}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n\n# Let's talk about irises!\n\n"
species_pattern <- "## Iris SPECIES_NAME\n\nThis species of flower is great! It has a mean sepal length of \n`r mean(iris[iris$Species == \"SPECIES_NAME\", \"Sepal.Length\"])`, and \nmean sepal width of `r mean(iris[iris$Species == \"SPECIES_NAME\", \"Sepal.Width\"])`. \nThat looks like this on a graph!\n\n```{r}\niris %>%\n  filter(Species == \"SPECIES_NAME\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) + \n  geom_point()\n```\n"
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# These can be any sort of plaintext file -- I tend to save them as .Rmd,
# so that I can see code highlighting in R Studio with them, but any extension
# should work fine
setup_pattern <- import_pattern("setup_pattern.Rmd")
species_pattern <- import_pattern("species_pattern.Rmd")
```

This gives us objects that contain strings like this:

```{r}
setup_pattern
```

However, it can be helpful in reports with multiple patterns to store 
everything in one object, just to have fewer things floating around your 
top-level environment. `heddlr` provides `heddlr::import_draft()` for this
purpose, wrapping an `lapply` call which will return a single list object 
holding all of your patterns:

```{r eval=FALSE}
iris_draft <- import_draft(
  "setup_pattern" = "setup_pattern.Rmd",
  "species_pattern" = "species_pattern.Rmd"
)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
iris_draft <- list(
  "setup_pattern" = setup_pattern,
  "species_pattern" = species_pattern
)
```

```{r}
iris_draft
```

Now that we've got our patterns into R, it's time to start working with them. 
To demonstrate how we do that with `heddlr`, we first need to load a few 
libraries:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
```

Our first function that we'll use to work with patterns is `heddlr::heddle()`.
On the most basic level, this is the function that will replace the 
placeholders in our patterns with our data. If we have a vector containing 
the values we want to use for each pattern, we're able to use this function
as follows and get a vector in return:

```{r}
# heddle takes three arguments: data, pattern, placeholder to replace
heddle(unique(iris$Species), "This is a pattern - CODE ", "CODE")
```

In the context of our example document, this function call would look like 
this:

```{r}
heddle(unique(iris$Species), iris_draft$species_pattern, "SPECIES_NAME")[[1]]
```

It isn't super important, but I think of the outputs from `heddle()` as being 
_components_ of a larger _template_, and will be using similar terminology
from here on out.

If we wanted to instead use `heddle()` as part of a magrittr pipeline, we can 
create new dataframe columns using `dplyr::mutate()`:

```{r}
iris %>%
  distinct(Species) %>%
  # exact same pattern of arguments: data, pattern, placeholder to replace
  mutate(component = heddle(Species, iris_draft$species_pattern, "SPECIES_NAME"))
```

We can also use `heddle()` as its own step in a pipeline. When we pass 
`heddle()` a dataframe like this, instead of a vector, we have to specify which
column we want to replace the placeholder with:

```{r}
iris %>%
  distinct(Species) %>%
  # the data argument is provided by %>%
  # so we just provide the pattern and placeholder
  # (format "PLACEHOLDER" = Variable)
  heddle("This is a pattern - CODE ", "CODE" = Species)
```

An advantage of this method is we can now replace multiple placeholders with 
our data in a single function call:

```{r}
iris %>%
  distinct(Species) %>%
  heddle("This is a pattern - CODE ", "CODE" = Species, "This" = Species)
```

One last way we can use `heddle()` is to use `purrr::map()` to apply it to 
nested columns made via `tidyr::nest()`. To do so, we just provide arguments 
in the same way as above:

```{r}
iris %>%
  nest(nested = Species) %>%
  mutate(component = map(nested,
    heddle,
    "This is a pattern - CODE ",
    "CODE" = Species
  )) %>%
  head(2)
```

This is also the supported way to change multiple placeholder values while 
saving a component as a column in a dataframe via mutate -- nest the columns 
you're using to replace placeholders with and then use `purrr` to replace the
placeholders in one step.

You'll notice that the output of this method is another list column, not the 
same string column we're used to seeing as an output. Those familiar with 
`purrr:map()` might know that we can get a character output from many 
dataframes with `purrr::map_chr()` -- however, this doesn't work with 
dataframes where you'll get more than one output from the `map()` call:

```{r eval=FALSE}
iris %>%
  nest(nested = Species) %>%
  mutate(component = map_chr(nested, heddle,
    "This is a pattern - CODE ",
    "CODE" = Species
  ))
# > Error: Result 102 must be a single string, not a character vector of length 2
```

Instead, we can turn to our next function, `heddlr::make_template()`. There 
are a few different ways that we can use this function. For our current 
situation, for instance, we can use `purrr::map_chr()` to apply 
`make_template()` to our new component list column, transforming it into the
normal set of strings we're used to:

```{r}
iris %>%
  nest(nested = Species) %>%
  mutate(
    component = map(nested, heddle, "This is a pattern - CODE ", "CODE" = Species),
    component = map_chr(component, make_template)
  ) %>%
  head(2)
```

In addition to this, there are two other contexts we can use `make_template()`.
If we pass it a dataframe and a vector, it will collapse that vector into a 
single string:

```{r}
iris %>%
  nest(nested = Species) %>%
  mutate(
    component = map(nested, heddle,
      "This is a pattern - CODE ",
      "CODE" = Species
    ),
    component = map_chr(component, make_template)
  ) %>%
  head(2) %>%
  make_template(component)
```

If instead the first argument we pass it is a vector, it will combine all the 
vectors you provide it into a single string:

```{r}
make_template("Part one, ", "part two")
```

In the context of our example report, these steps would look something like 
this:

```{r}
species_template <- iris %>%
  distinct(Species) %>%
  mutate(component = heddle(
    Species,
    iris_draft$species_pattern,
    "SPECIES_NAME"
  )) %>%
  make_template(component)

report_template <- make_template(iris_draft$setup_pattern, species_template)
```

I refer to these output strings as _templates_, which are the second to last
step in the `heddlr` pipeline. However, in order to actually create our 
reports, we need to export these templates to .Rmd files. In order to do that,
`heddlr` provides a helpful function, aptly named `heddlr::export_template()`. 
Normally, `export_template` takes two arguments -- the template to write out, 
and the file to write it out to. Here, I'm going to tell it to print to 
`stdout()` instead -- that will just output here what our sample report 
would look like:

```{r}
suppressWarnings(export_template(report_template, stdout()))
```

And there we have it! Repeating the above steps will always generate sections 
for each flower included in your dataset, whether or not Joe down the hall
remembered to tell you about it.

To recap, the essential steps to make our report can be summed up as follows:

* First, we decomposed our report into patterns, saved as individual .Rmd 
  files.
* We then imported those files using either `import_pattern()` or 
  `import_draft()`
* We replicated the patterns and replaced placeholders using `heddle()`
* We combined those components into templates via `make_template()`
* We exported our final template into a report through `export_template()`

I'll usually save these steps into a "generator" file, which I can then run 
every time I need to regenerate my report. I'll also often include a step in 
that file that calls `rmarkdown::render()` on the generated report file, so 
that I can just run a single script in order to remake and rebuild my entire 
report. Obviously, this can be something of an overkill for reports as simple
as our example here, but it can be a huge time saver for more complex reports 
that have more repeating sections, built more often, or are based on more 
dynamic data sources that require maintenance to add or remove components
between builds. It also can help make your code 
DRYer^[[Don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)]
so you can make edits in a single place and see them replicated across your
entire report.
